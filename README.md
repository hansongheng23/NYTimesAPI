# NYTimesAPI
There are three files. The .py file is the python code for transfer .json file you get from NYtimesAPI in a .csv file.   
.json file is an example that I use and the key word I use is 'Obama'.  
.csv file is the result that I convert from .json file.  
The .ipynb is the ipython(jupyter) notebook file.  
  
***before doing anything***  
Make sure you have installed **Anaconda** and **NYTimes API**  
Information of NYTimes API installation can be found in:
